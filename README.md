## Overview
This repository contains small Python scripts focused on correctness,
input validation, and simple workflow-style logic.

## Purpose
Created to strengthen programming fundamentals while working in a
QA and workflow validation role, with emphasis on clear and defensive code.

## Contents
- Input validation using loops and exception handling
- Safe file read operations
- Simple workflow state validation

## Notes
These scripts are intentionally simple and prioritise clarity and
correctness over complexity.

## How to Run
Each script can be run independently using Python 3.

Example:
python input_validation.py
python file_reader.py
python workflow_check.py
